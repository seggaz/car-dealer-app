# Car Dealer App

Car Dealer App is a simple Next.js application that allows users to filter vehicles by make and model year. The app consists of two main pages: a **Filter Page** where users can select a vehicle make and model year, and a **Result Page** where the filtered car models are displayed.

## Features:

- **Filter Page**: Users can select a vehicle make (via an API call) and model year (2015 to the current year).
- **Dynamic Result Page**: Based on selected filters, the app fetches and displays car models from an API.
- **React Suspense**: The app uses React's Suspense component for managing loading states.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled using Tailwind CSS to ensure mobile-friendly and accessible UI.

## Technologies Used:

- **Next.js** for SSR and routing.
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
- **Axios** for API requests.
- **React Suspense** for data fetching handling.
